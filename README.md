# Hacktoberfest 20!

# Website for a friend

So I need to make a website for a friend, but since it's October and I've got enough other repos to contribute to, I thought this would be a good repo for other beginners to contribute and get their PRs up :)

You are free to choose any framework, the aim is to make this repo as open and welcoming as possible.
So, my friend offers software services and harddisk data recovery solutions. And that's what the website will have to advertise. 
Few of the services include laptop and pc repairs, but the emphasis should really be on HardDisk Data Recovery.

What I require is:
1) A four page website - index, contact us, about us, reviews
2) Slick frontend. Doesn't have to be over the top, but shouldn't look like a website from the 90s ;)

I'm actually gonna stop right there, as I'd like to leave a lot of choices upto y'all, the design, stack, frameworks.
So you're all welcome to make PRs, and in the end I'll choose one, and will credit you as a contributor :)

Head over to [issues](https://github.com/hot9cups/website-for-friend/issues) and start contributing already :)
