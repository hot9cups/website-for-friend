# Website for a friend

I'm looking to get a simple website up for a friend to help them advertise their store offering software services, laptop & pc repairs and harddisk data recovery solutions.

You are free to choose any framework, the aim is to make this repo as open and welcoming as possible.

The requirements for a valid PR are:
1) A four page website - index, contact us, about us, reviews
2) Slick frontend. Doesn't have to be over the top, but shouldn't look like a website from the 90s.

About the format for making contributions, that's fairly simple. Simply Create another folder with all your work inside it, and push that directory right onto the master branch. You could name the folder with your name, github username or whatever you feel appropriate.

If this is of interest to you, head over to [issues](https://github.com/hot9cups/website-for-friend/issues) and feel free to start contributing.
